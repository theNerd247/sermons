# Intro

# Blessed ? 

Should include this one?

The blessing was done before time started and so it was not an after thought.

__Imagine that. You were not an after thought to God.__

# Chose 

God → chose → you
      ├─ (who)  in Him (Christ)
      ├─ (when) before the foundation of the world → the creation of time and space.
      └─ (why)  that we might be holy, and blameless before Him (God the Father?)

"chose"
: Grk. "exelexato" (first middle aorist of "eklego" 
: "to select (pick out) for one's self"
: The subject acts in his own interest.

> "... He selected us out for himself in Him before the foundations of the
> universe were laid..."
> - Wuest

"that we would be holy and blameless before Him"
: the Greek points to the context being someone gazing into something upon
inspection; which is done with the purpose of finding satisfaction and not that
of finding fault: 

> "And it is not a searching gaze conducted in a critical attituded which looks
> for faults, but a satisfied, delighted contemplation of the reflection of the
> holiness and spotlessness of the Lord Jesus in the character of the saint,
> for Alford says; "implying an especial nearness and dearness to Him - and
> bearing a foretaste of the time when the elect shall be before the throne of
> God (Rev. 7:15)."
> - Wuest

Essential points:

  * God chose you

  * The reason for chosing you was so that when He looked on you He would open
    a big wide smile and be pleased with how He saw you.

  * (if you are saved - i.e. one of the chosen) God is not looking for faults
    within you. He is pleased with who you are.

I had a step-mother growing up who would inspect the result of my chores before
I was allowed to leave the house - ever (before school, before going outside to
play). I had to ask for permission; upon which - at her leisure - she would
walk around the house - my room, the bathroom, the kitchen, etc. - and look for
faults. If she couldn't find one then she was pleased. She was searching for
faults and her pleasure came from the lack of faults. God searches those whom
He chose to see the wonderful handy work that He did; not to find faults within
us.  Our value comes from our position in Christ. And while God reveals those
things to us that are behind the different partitions of our life it is for the
purpose of our benefit and His pleasure of making us into His Son. It's a gift
that keeps on giving! 

Often we inspect others with the intent of fault finding. It's those sentences
that start like: "They had better not ..." or "Did they just...?" or "I hope
they didn't ...". We are hoping something is wrong with them or with what they
had done. This is called "having a critical attitude" - it's fault finding in
other people. We shouldn't do this because God - who ought to be the biggest
fault finder in us - DOESN'T. When we come into God's family He doesn't try
and find out all our faults when He looks at us.
