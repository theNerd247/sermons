# Intro

Struggle with allowing yourself to be loved by others?  Wrestling with holding
a grudge against God?  Wondering what your career should be?

Let's look at a few things that God declares about you and Himself. 

What makes life vibrant? Also, how are you supposed to live the Christian life?

Many Christians go through life feeling like a hamster on a wheel. They try as
hard as they can to obey God only to run out of steam and fall into a dry
spell.  God feels distant and, frankly, unpleasant. You may even feel ashamed
to aproach Him in prayer - or when you force your self to pray you can't wait
to stop. Life feels like a bunch of checkboxes and as soon as you check them
all off it turns out there's more on the next page!

God does not want you to live life like this. He wants your life to be vibrant
and filled with a deep relationship with Him. 

You might ask - how come God doesn't just reveal Himself to me when I'm saved?
Because he gives you free will though he is not going to magically force you
into having a deep relationship with Him. He wants to teach you through the
rough times so that your relationship with Him is natural and strong.


God does reveal Himself to us through - through the written word found in the
Bible.  A quick note of this the Bible - in its original languages - is the
authoritative word of God that was divinely superintended. God intends to
communicate to you and is not playing a game of 20 questions. He wants you
to understand Him as plain as day. However, He wants you to He hear Him on His
terms. We can learn from God Himself and what He has spoken directly to us by
reading and studying God's word.

So let's take a look at a few things that God's word says about your
relationship with Him in Ephesians chapter 1. 

  * Blessed
  * Chosen
  * Adopted
  * Forgiven
  * Sealed
  * Loved

## Cross References

(adopted) Romans 8:15, Gal 4:6, Mark 14:36

# Intro

# Blessed ? 

# Chose 

__Imagine that. You were not an after thought to God.__

God → chose → you
      ├─ (who)  in Him (Christ)
      ├─ (when) before the foundation of the world → the creation of time and
      │         space.
      └─ (why)  that we might be holy, and blameless before Him (God the
                Father)

"chose"
: Grk. "exelexato" (first middle aorist of "eklego" 
: "to select (pick out) for one's self"
: The subject acts in his own interest.

God saved us because He wanted to. Not because of what you did. You cannot do
enough good to out weigh the bad. In God's eyes there's no such thing as a
"good enough person".

> "... He selected us out for himself in Him before the foundations of the
> universe were laid..."
> - Wuest

"that we would be holy and blameless before Him"
: the Greek points to the context being someone gazing into something upon
inspection; which is done with the purpose of finding satisfaction and not that
of finding fault: 

> "And it is not a searching gaze conducted in a critical attituded which looks
> for faults, but a satisfied, delighted contemplation of the reflection of the
> holiness and spotlessness of the Lord Jesus in the character of the saint,
> for Alford says; "implying an especial nearness and dearness to Him - and
> bearing a foretaste of the time when the elect shall be before the throne of
> God (Rev. 7:15)."
> - Wuest

Essential points:

  * God chose you before you even existed; you are eternal in the sense that 
    God had your design and name made up before you even existed.

  * The reason for chosing you was so that when He looked on you He would open
    a big wide smile and be pleased with how He saw you.

  * Holy and blameless are talking about how God sees your character. You are 
    to be different than the rest of the world - a unique purpose - and you
    are destined to be without fault before God.

  * (if you are saved - i.e. one of the chosen) God is not looking for faults
    within you. He is pleased with who you are.

_Application point_

Often we inspect others with the intent of fault finding. It's those sentences
that start like: "They had better not ..." or "Did they just...?" or "I hope
they didn't ...", or my favorite: "Well technically..." . We have found or are
hoping to find something is wrong with them or with what they had done. This is
called "having a critical attitude" - it's fault finding in other people. We
shouldn't do this because God - who ought to be the biggest fault finder in us
DOESN'T. When we come into God's family He doesn't try and find out all our
faults when He looks at us. For one He already knows them - but 2nd He
gracefully wiped them away from us in order to see us as He created us - His
creation to bear His image and have a deep relationship with him.

__Good analogy on grace vs critical attitude__

Going to a restraunt to praise the chef vs judging the quality of the place.

  a). gets the food and opens the steak and smells the sauce because they are 
      excited to see the handy work that God has created - they have a grace
      filled eye.
  b). gets the food and opens the steak and smells the sauce to make sure 
      the chef didn't get anything wrong - they have a critical eye.

Col 1:22 
  - seen as the Goal of Christ.
  - we will eventually be able to be blameless and without affect of sin.
  - The Holy Spirit is wanting to work in you and make you into something 
    that God is proud of.

# Adopted

He predestined us 
  ├─ (how) In love
  ├─ (what) to adoption as sons 
  ├─ (how) through Jesus Christ
  ├─ (who) to Himself (God the Father)
  ├─ (why) according to the kind intention of his will (he wanted to)
  ├─ (why) to the praise of the glory of His grace
  └─ (what) (side-effect) which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved

_Probably a good idea to break this down first_

_Good illustrations?_

Psalm 103 has some good verses relating to this

# Forgiven

In Him 
  ├─ (what) we have redemption
  ├─ (how) through His blood
  ├─ (what) the forgiveness of our trespasses
  └─ (how) according to the riches of His grace which He lavished on us

What does redemption mean?
What does forgiveness mean?

Psalm 103:9-14

God created us; not evolution. Because of this God knows we are weak on our
own. And that we are going to make mistakes.

It's like when a baby is still learning to walk. You would never dare push a
child down and tell them to give up they'll never make it! No, you cheer them
on! When they fall you hold them close if they crying and then you cheer them
on! You know they'll eventually get it. Now on the other hand you don't grab
the legs of the child and do the walking for them - that would be weird.

All this is the same with God. He knows we're going to spend our whole lives
learning to be like Christ. He doesn't push us down and say "You'll never make
it! Give up now!". While He will discipline us because we're his sons and
daughters He will always keep encouraging you to grow closer to him.

# Sealed

# Loves

All of the above is proof that God loves you.

v5. 

"love"
: Grk. adopted
: the highest form of love  
: ??? deeply emotional
: ??? a love based on value that is extrinsic to the object that is being loved 
: ??? often a choice and independent of the object being loved.

John 3:16

# Application

## To the saved

# In Him

Every verb that has God as the subject:

  * that verb is aorist 
  * the subject is us (Christians)
  * there is a prepositional phrase "in Him"

This refers to all that Christ had set out to accomplish here on earth.
