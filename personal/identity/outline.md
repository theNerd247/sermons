# God's Criticalness and our Criticalness

> "just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would
> be holy and blameless before Him."

Before space-time existed God had you planned out and in His mind and is calling you
to live a life that is holy and blameless.

_What does holy and blameless before Him mean?_

holy
: to be set seperated out and be used for a special purpose

blameless
: without fault; spotless; perfect

1 Peter 1:14-16
> "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were
> yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy
> yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, “You shall be
> holy, for I am holy.”


Paul is saying: In light of you being chosen through Christ's death and resurrection start
living a life that is seperated out and perfect before God.

_God is calling us to live a perfect life._

before Him
: gives the idea of looking into something in order to inspect it

God is constantly looking down into each person
* The purpose is to see Christ's character in us and  not to see fault and nit
  pick our short comings 

* We are not perfect but when God looks at us He 

  * doesn't see we are as the sum of all our flaws and strengths.
  * sees us as His perfect Son 

Restraunt analogy:

  * Friend recommends 
  * You set aside main course as special meal
  * 2 ways you can expect the quality of the food

    * critical eye: 

      * "I hope the food is hot enough"
      * "I hope it's not to salty"
      * expects people / things to live up to their standards
    * complimentary eye: 

      * "I can't wait to see the best of the chef"
      * "I'm excited to taste it"
      * Expects the best from others but has realistic expectations - standards are left to God

    * You could still be disappointed 
    * God can be disappointed in what we do but He is constantly looking for Christ in us.

# How to not have a critical attitude

## Adoption

> "predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself"

: God says "everyone who is saved will be called my son/daughter"

adoption 
: your identity now belongs to God
: Who you are right now is a child of the most High God and creator of the
  universe. 
: You are not the sum of your best and worst moments or experiences in life.
: You are not your career 


> "According to the kind intention of His will"

> This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure 
> - Eph 1:5 (NLT)

God wanted to adopt you and not only that it put a huge grin on His face!

> "to the praise of the glory of His grace, which he has freely given us in the
> beloved"

grace
: favor shown to someone that is undeserved
: doing something really good to someone when they deserve something really bad
  to happen to them
: something that can't be payed back

* God showing us His grace by sending Christ to die for us is _something you'll
  never be able to pay back._

* By letting this truth sink in to your heart you will begin to be free from
  having a critical attitude and really begin to enjoy life.

* Critical people have a hard time grasping grace - or worse: they reject it -
  because they always feel they have to prove themselves and their worth.

  * I have to be smart - I always have to create the best solution the fastest
    or there is something wrong with me
  * I have to be successful - I must win every time or there is something wrong
    with me
  * I have to be friendly - I have to be complimented by everyone or there is
    something wrong with me
  * I have to ______ or there is something wrong with me.

* Christians with a critical attitude are trying to earn God's favor without
  knowing it because they see their worth in what they do instead of who they
  already are. 

## Forgiven

Psalm 103:11-14

If you struggle with having a critical attitude say to yourself:

  > "I have nothing to prove. God showed me grace when I couldn't be perfect by
  > adopting me and forgiving me. It's ok if I make a mistake right now. He loves
  > me no matter what"

# Application

## To the unsaved

2 Peter 3: passage on not wanting those to perish (as last part to those not
saved)

## To the saved

1 John 3:2-3 if we are God's children then we should purify ourselves because
God has declared us pure in His sight.

1 John 1:9 - God is ready to forgive you from the sin you have committed, are
committing, and may commit.

Jude 24
