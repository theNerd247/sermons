# Intro

## Bite

My personal relationship with God is best described by...
  
  * ...a hamster running on a wheel (but I keep falling off)
  * ...running from the cops
  * ...we hang out every now and then
  * ...I'm not sure; God feels distant or I don't think about Him much
  * ...like a bush growing in garden

> Eph 1:3
> "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every
> spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ"

Praise be to God!

# God's Criticalness and our Criticalness

> "just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would
> be holy and blameless before Him."

Before space-time existed God had you planned out and in His mind and is calling you
to live a life that is holy and blameless.

_What does holy and blameless before Him mean?_

holy
: to be set seperated out and be used for a special purpose

blameless
: without fault; spotless; perfect

> 1 Peter 1:14-16
> "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were
> yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy
> yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, “You shall be
> holy, for I am holy.”


Paul is saying: In light of you being chosen through Christ's death and resurrection start
living a life that is seperated out and perfect before God.

_God is calling us to live a perfect life._

before Him
: gives the idea of looking into something in order to inspect it

God is constantly looking down into each person

* to see Christ's character in us 
* not to see fault and nit pick our short comings 

Restraunt analogy:

  * Friend recommends 
  * You set aside main course as special meal
  * 2 ways you can expect the quality of the food

    * critical eye: 

      * "I hope the food is hot enough"
      * "I hope it's not to salty"
      * expects people / things to live up to their standards
    * complimentary eye: 

      * "I can't wait to see the best of the chef"
      * "I'm excited to taste it"
      * Expects the best from others but has realistic expectations - standards are left to God

    * God can be disappointed in what we do but He is constantly looking for Christ in us.

_Many of us get the idea of living a perfect life. But still feel like we're on
a spiritual treadmill. God is at the top of an ever growing ladder. You
constantly go through cycles of God feeling close and you feeling like the scum
of the earth_

_This is because we have not yet graspsed what Paul talks about next:_ Our
identity in Christ and how God sees us.

# Seeing ourselves with a proper lens

_Many of us know God is calling us to a perfect life. But we mix up what God
calls perfect with our own perceptions of what perfect is or means.  We distort
reality by setting standards for our selves and way higher than God ever
intended_.

There might be some of you that feel like you're never good enough or others
aren't good enough. You may think to low of your self or to high. Both are
forms of perfectionism.

Let's look at a few key truths that will help free you from having a critical
attitude:

# Adoption

First is to being seeing who you are in Christ.

> Eph 1:4b-5a
> "In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself"

* God says "everyone who is saved I love unconditionally and will be called my
  son/daughter and adopted into my family"

adoption 
: your identity now belongs to God
: Who you are right now is a child of the most High God and creator of the
  universe. 
: You are not the sum of your best and worst moments or experiences in life.
: You are not your career 

> Eph 1:5b
> "According to the kind intention of His will"

NLT says :

> This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure 
> - Eph 1:5 (NLT)

God wanted to adopt you and not only that it put a huge grin on His face!

_You are not an after thought to God! You are not a mistake!_

> Eph 1:6
> "to the praise of the glory of His grace, which he has freely given us in the
> beloved"

## Grace

The Second key is to begin grasping grace

grace
: favor shown to someone that is undeserved
: doing something really good to someone when they deserve something really bad
  to happen to them
: something that can't be payed back (the scary part)

Some ways to grasp grace are:

  * Be patient with people when they do something that irritates you or hurts
    you
  * See people for who they are not what they do. 
  * (Might be the hardest) Allow other people to love on you _especially when
    you do something wrong_

Critical people have a hard time grasping grace - or worse: they reject it -
because they always feel they have to prove themselves and their worth.

  * I have to be smart - I always have to create the best solution the fastest
    or there is something wrong with me
  * I have to be successful - I must win every time or there is something wrong
    with me
  * I have to be friendly - I have to be complimented by everyone or there is
    something wrong with me
  * I have to ______ or there is something wrong with me.

> Ephesians 2:8-10
> "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves,
> it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
> For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
> prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."

* Christians with a critical attitude are trying to earn God's favor without
  knowing it because they see their worth in what they do instead of who they
  already are. 

## Redeemed 

The second key is to understand that God has set you free from the power of sin.

> Eph 1:7
> "In Him we have redemption through His blood"

redeemed 
: to buy out of the slave market and set free permanently

Elephants at a circus
  
  * chained when they're really young. At the time they cannot resist
  * when the elephant gets much older and larger though they have the potential
    to break the chain they don't because they still think it will hold them
    down.

Many of us who struggle with perfectionism were trained this way when they were
really young. I know because I was abused as a child and grew up in a rough
home. 

* Begin to realize that if you submit yourself to God you will change into a
  person that you and others will love. (Because of how they see God in you).
  __YOU CAN BE FREE FROM PERFECTIONISM__
* Allow the Holy Spirit to bring to your memory areas of your life that need to
  change. For me this meant learning to address the pain of my past and
  admiting that I needed help and didn't know how to fix myself.
* Don't feel like you have to change overnight; don't be a perfectionist about
  not being a perfectionist.

## Forgiven

> Eph 1:7b
>  the forgiveness of our trespasses
> according to the riches of His grace which He lavished on us."

Psalm 103:11-14

If you struggle with having a critical attitude say to yourself:

> "I have nothing to prove. God showed me grace when I couldn't be perfect by
> adopting me and forgiving me. It's ok if I make a mistake right now. He loves
> me no matter what"

Forgiveness 
: letting go of the wrong done to you or by you
: changing how you feel about that person and being seeing them as God sees
them.

* Make a conscious choice to forgive
* Be specific about what hurt you (or what you did wrong)
* Release that person from feelings of anamosity and bitterness.

# Application

1. Seek the scriptures about how God sees you.
1. Learn to show and accept grace from others
1. Open your life to the Holy Spirit so that you might start living out the
   freedom you already have
1. Continuously forgive those who have hurt you and yourself for things you've
   done wrong

## To the unsaved

> 2 Peter 3:9
> "The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is
> patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to
> repentance."

* God doesn't want any of us to perish and so He is patiently waiting for you
  to accept His free gift and life the exciting life that He intended for you
  to live.

* He will knock but He is not going to force you into coming to Him.

## To the saved

> Eph 4:1
> "walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called"

* This is done by abstaining from sin and continuously confessing specific sins
  in your life and allowing the Holy Spirit to bring to mind areas of your life
  that He needs to change and submitting them to Him on a momemnt by moment
  basis.

> 1 John 1:9 
> "If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us and cleans us
> from all unrighteousness"

* God is ready to forgive you from the sin you have committed, are committing,
  and may commit.

> Jude 1:24
> "Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in
> the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, to the only God our
> Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and
> authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen."
