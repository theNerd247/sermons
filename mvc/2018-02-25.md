# The People God Honors

Phil 2: 19-20

## Intro

Often to get people on board it is better to first live what you wish other
people to do first. And as they see it they will get on board with it.

Truth is better caught than taught.

A man is not measured by how many servants he has, but how many men he serves.

When we are humble we put ourselves in the position to have joy.

## Context

Paul wanted to send Timothy back to Philippi

Timothy was the best Paul had.
