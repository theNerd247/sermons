% A sold out servant's Goal - Romans 13:8-10
% Dr. Byron Morgan

# Intro

God comes into our lives, at salvation, after having seen value in a old beat
up house, and He moves in and begins a divine renovation.

God doesn't want to just exist inside the house. The #1 goal of the Holy Spirit
is that he produce in each of us a renewed life.

Justification
* you are _declared_ (not made) righteous
* given at the point of salvation

After this we never hear anything else about the Christian life. 


Sanctification

* God begins to work His life into our lives
* It is the process of making us more Christ-like
* _Romans 6:19_

God doesn't want us to stay as private first class. He wants us to progress!
