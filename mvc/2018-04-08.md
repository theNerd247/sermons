# The Keys to Peace

Guest speaker: Michael Wahl

__Acts 9__

## Intro

* How can we have peace by the end of the day?
* Oft we have direction in life with the wrong intentions
* What is peace?

## v3 Blinded eyes

Chrsit closes Saul's eye so he could hear what he had to say

### Why didn't the guys get taken out around Saul?
So that Saul could be lead by other people.

### Ananias 

This is the only place this Ananias is mentioned in Scripture.

#### v13 - Questioning God

"I must show him how much he must suffer".

Ananias didn't want to move becuase of fear.

_Fear is the enemy to peace_


#### v15 - The Choice (not part of the sermon)

Paul was chosen regardless of his past.

#### v17 - Obedience

Ananias obeys, and by showing up initiates the process Saul was going through to
becoming Paul. From a human perspective this was insignifigant; a small act.
However the impact of obedience was a part of God's major plan.

## Application

* Peace comes through faith
* Peace comes through submission
* Peace comes through obedience.
