% Is Something Missing
% Dr. Byron Morgan

# Intro

During this season when there should be more cheer and joy there seems to 
have something that is missing.

God's Word -> Everything in state of flux

Logs := God's word

Logos was what gave man the ability to think and reason

Law and truth

"dwelt" -> eskenosen; pitched his tent

# Grace came near

John 1:14

# Jesus was full of Grace

# Jesus was full of truth

# His Grace will never end

John 1:16 

"upon" -> { "anit"; against;} -> "For out of his fullness as a source we have recieved even grace in the place of grace"

Balancing the christian life by Charles Ryrie

# Application

Who is it in your life that it is most difficult to extend grace?
Is it difficult for yo uto imagine a God of Grace?
