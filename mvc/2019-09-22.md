% Encouragement and Hope
% Dr. Byron Morgan

# Intro

Living in this world is difficult and stressful but Jesus says "Take heart"
(John 16?)

How do we take heart? John 17:13-14.

"I do not ask you to take them out of the world".  

> Lord help them to have their minds so saturated with your word that they
> would be able to resist the things of the world.

Romans 15-16 has so much truth for encouragement to help one another to
continue on in the world. The winds of life blow strongly! How do we keep
our young saplings from blowing over? We need guy wire, stakes, and good,
deep, nutrient filled soil.

Romans 15 - the law of love vs. liberty. Even though we may have a freedom in
Christ, we should not use that freedom to be selfish - or to offend a brother
in Christ. The source of this encouragement leads to hope.

Ps. 69:9

Are you an encourager? Or are you a nit-picker and complainer?

Obeying God's word is like a knee brace - it prevents pain from occuring in our
life due to our joints from being put out of place.
